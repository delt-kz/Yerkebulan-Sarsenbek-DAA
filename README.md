# Divide & Conquer Algorithms ‚Äì Analysis Report

## üìê Architecture Notes

### Recursion Depth Control
- **MergeSort**: Depth controlled by balanced splitting (‚åàlog‚ÇÇn‚åâ). Cut-off to insertion sort for small subarrays prevents deep recursion on small inputs.
- **QuickSort**: Randomized pivot + smaller-partition-first recursion ensures O(log n) depth even on adversarial inputs. Iterative tail recursion eliminates one recursive call.
- **Deterministic Select**: Median-of-medians guarantees balanced partitioning, limiting depth to O(log n). Single recursion path based on pivot position.
- **Closest Pair**: Balanced splitting by x-coordinate gives O(log n) depth. Strip optimization reduces y-comparisons.

### Memory Allocation Control
- **MergeSort**: Single reusable buffer allocated once (O(n) total). In-place insertion sort for small arrays.
- **QuickSort**: Completely in-place (O(1) extra space). Randomized pivot avoids worst-case stack depth.
- **Deterministic Select**: In-place partitioning with O(1) extra space. Median groups handled via small temporary arrays.
- **Closest Pair**: O(n) space for sorted copies by x and y. Strip optimization uses O(‚àön) temporary space.

## üìä Recurrence Analysis

### MergeSort
- **Recurrence**: `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)`
- **Method**: Master Theorem (Case 2)
- **Result**: Œò(n log n)
- **Intuition**: Work evenly split, merge is linear ‚Üí fits Case 2 exactly.

### QuickSort
- **Recurrence**: `T(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + O(n)`
- **Method**: Akra-Bazzi for randomized analysis
- **Result**: Expected Œò(n log n), worst-case Œò(n¬≤)
- **Intuition**: Randomized pivot ‚Üí expected n/2 split. Smaller-first recursion keeps stack depth O(log n).

### Deterministic Select
- **Recurrence**: `T(n) = T(n/5) + T(7n/10) + O(n)`
- **Method**: Akra-Bazzi (Master Theorem intuition)
- **Result**: Œò(n)
- **Intuition**: At least 30% eliminated each round ‚Üí geometric series O(n).

### Closest Pair
- **Recurrence**: `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)`
- **Method**: Master Theorem (Case 2)
- **Result**: Œò(n log n)
- **Intuition**: Divide points, linear strip validation cost.

## üìä Experimental Results with Plots

The benchmarks can be executed from  
`src/main/java/ru/yandex/practicum/client/AlgorithmBenchmark.java`.  
Results are written to `algorithm_metrics.csv` and can then be visualized.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Time vs Input Size
The following plot shows execution time (in nanoseconds) versus input size.  
Logarithmic scales are used for both axes to highlight growth trends.

![Time vs n](src/main/resources/graph/timeToN.png)

**Observations:**
- **QuickSort** consistently outperforms MergeSort for large inputs due to better cache locality.
- **MergeSort** is slower, mainly because of buffer copying overhead.
- **Deterministic Select** and **Closest Pair** have much higher constant factors, despite good asymptotic bounds.

### üåÄ Recursion Depth vs Input Size
The recursion depth across input sizes is shown below:

![Recursion Depth vs n](src/main/resources/graph/recursionToDepth.png)

**Observations:**
- **MergeSort** follows the expected ‚åàlog‚ÇÇn‚åâ depth.
- **QuickSort** maintains logarithmic stack usage but at a slightly lower level than MergeSort.
- **Deterministic Select** and **Closest Pair** also grow logarithmically, but with larger constants.

### ‚ö° Constant-Factor Effects in Practice
- **Cache locality** explains the gap between QuickSort and MergeSort in the time plot.
- **Garbage Collection (GC)** pressure is visible in MergeSort (temporary arrays) and Select (median groups).
- **Large constants** in Select and Closest Pair make them less practical than theory alone suggests.

## üìå Theory vs Measurements Summary

### ‚úÖ Strong Alignment
- Time Complexity: Matches theoretical growth rates.
- Recursion Depth: Matches O(log n) expectations.
- Relative Performance: **QuickSort > MergeSort > Closest Pair > Select**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Mismatches
- Cache behavior widens real performance gaps.
- QuickSort depth ‚âà 2log‚ÇÇn vs O(log n).
- Select overhead: ~3√ó vs sorting (median-of-medians cost).

## üîç Validation Insights
- Randomization prevents QuickSort worst-case.
- Closest Pair strip optimization = expected O(n) combine.
- Cut-offs improve small-case handling.
- Memory access patterns dominate constant factors in practice.

‚úçÔ∏è **Conclusion**:  
The implementations strongly align with theory, while real-world effects (cache, allocation, constants) reveal the *practical trade-offs* in divide & conquer algorithms.
